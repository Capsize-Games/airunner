    This function creates directories based on the paths provided in the path_settings dictionary.

    The function validates the paths, sanitizes them by removing "..", checks if the application has
    the necessary permissions to create a directory in the specified path, and handles any exceptions
    that might occur when creating the directory.

    Parameters:
    path_settings (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the names of the paths and the values are
    the paths themselves.
