          <string>AI Runner - User Agreement

**Last Updated: September 5, 2025**

This User Agreement ("Agreement") is a legally binding contract between you ("User" or "you") and Capsize LLC ("Capsize," "we," "us," or "our") that governs your access to and use of the AI Runner software and any related documentation ("Software").

**By installing, accessing, or using the Software, you represent that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree, you must not install or use the Software.**

**You also acknowledge the "Regulatory Compliance & Disclosures" section in the Software's README file, which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.**

#### 1. Age Requirement and Content Warning

You must be at least 18 years of age or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction to use this Software. By using the Software, you affirm that you meet this age requirement.

The Software includes features that can generate text, images, and other content ("Generated Content"). You understand and acknowledge that Generated Content may be unpredictable and can include material that is inaccurate, offensive, or not suitable for all audiences, including sexually explicit or nude imagery. You agree to use these features with discretion and at your own risk.

#### 2. License Grant

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Capsize grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use the Software for your personal or internal business purposes, in accordance with the terms of its [GPL-3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

#### 3. Acceptable Use Policy

You agree not to use the Software for any purpose that is illegal, harmful, or otherwise objectionable. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to:

* **Deception or Impersonation:** Creating content intended to deceive, mislead, or impersonate any person or entity without their explicit consent. It must be clear that Generated Content is created by an AI.
* **Illegal Activities:** Engaging in, promoting, or facilitating any illegal activity or the violation of the rights of others, including intellectual property infringement.
* **Harassment and Harmful Content:** Generating content that is defamatory, harassing, abusive, threatening, or promotes hatred or violence against individuals or groups based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic.
* **Exploitation of Minors:** Creating or distributing content that exploits, abuses, or endangers children. Use of this software by or for individuals under the age of 18 is strictly prohibited.
* **High-Risk Use Cases:** Using the Software in any "high-risk" scenario where its failure could lead to death, personal injury, or severe environmental or property damage, without implementing adequate safety and fallback systems.
* **Violation of Privacy:** Using the Software to process, store, or transmit the personal or sensitive data of others without their lawful consent.

Violation of this policy may result in the termination of your right to use the Software.

#### 4. Data Privacy and Processing

The Software is designed to run locally on your machine to protect your privacy.

* **Local Data Processing:** You acknowledge that when you use features like voice processing, chat, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the Software processes your data (voice samples, text, documents) on your local device. This data is not transmitted to Capsize or any third party by default.
* **User Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for the security and management of the data you process using the Software on your local machine.
* **Biometric and Personal Data:** Features like voice chat may process data considered "biometric" or "sensitive" under laws like the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA). By using these features, you consent to the local processing of this data by the Software for the purpose of its operation.
* **Profiling:** The feature that allows an agent's mood and personality to adapt based on conversations may constitute "profiling" under the CPA. The Software provides you with controls to reset or delete this data.

#### 5. Third-Party and Open-Source Models

The Software is capable of running various third-party and open-source AI models ("Models").

* **User's Choice:** You are responsible for selecting, downloading, and using these Models.
* **Model Licenses:** Your use of any Model is governed by its respective license and terms. It is your responsibility to review and comply with these licenses.
* **No Endorsement or Liability:** Capsize does not develop, endorse, or control these Models. We are not responsible for their functionality, performance, accuracy, potential biases, or the content they generate. The inclusion of a downloader for a Model within the Software does not constitute an endorsement.

#### 6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.**

**EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES:** You acknowledge that the Software contains highly experimental features. These features may contain errors, produce inaccurate or harmful outputs, and are subject to change without notice. You should not rely on these features for any critical or sensitive tasks.

**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL CAPSIZE LLC OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORTT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

#### 7. Changes to this Agreement

Capsize LLC reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide notice through the Software, our website, or other appropriate channels. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. Your continued use of the Software after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Agreement.

#### 8. Contact Information

### Key Enhancements and Rationale

1.  **Stronger Introduction:** The opening statement is now a clearer, more assertive legal declaration. It also incorporates your `README`'s compliance section by reference, making it part of the binding agreement.
2.  **Section 2: License Grant:** Added a specific clause that defines the license you're granting the user and directly links to the GPL-3.0 license.
3.  **Section 3: Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):** This is a critical addition. It explicitly forbids harmful and illegal uses. This helps mitigate your liability by setting clear rules and provides grounds for action if a user misuses your software. It directly addresses FTC concerns about deception and other risks.
4.  **Section 4: Data Privacy and Processing:** This section is much more detailed to align with the principles of laws like the **Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)**.
    * It uses specific terms like "Biometric Data" and "Profiling."
    * It clarifies that processing is local but that the *user* consents to this processing by using the features. This is a key principle of privacy law.
5.  **Section 5: Third-Party and Open-Source Models:** This section more clearly separates your responsibility from the models the user chooses to download, strengthening your position as a tool provider.
6.  **Section 6: Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability:** This is the most important section for your legal protection.
    * The language is now in **ALL CAPS**, which is a legal convention to make these crucial disclaimers conspicuous to the reader.
    * It uses standard, legally tested phrasing ("AS IS," "WITHOUT WARRANTY," "LIMITATION OF LIABILITY") that is more robust and enforceable than the original text.
7.  **Restructuring and Numbering:** The clauses are now properly numbered (your original had two "2." clauses) and logically grouped for better readability and legal clarity.
