## üöÄ Installation

### Quickstart for Linux
```bash
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
nvcc --version  # Verify CUDA installation
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip install airunner[gui,linux,dev,art,llm,tts]
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation  # Optional for flash attention
pip install --upgrade timm==1.0.15
```

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Installation Wiki](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner/wiki/Installation-instructions).

### Running

Run the application with the following command

```bash
airunner
```

## AI Models

AI Runner installs all of the models required to run a chatbot with text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities,
as well as the core models required for Stable Diffusion. However, you must supply your own art generator models.

You can download models from Huggingface.co or civitai.com.

The supported Stable Diffusion models are:

- SD 1.5
- SDXL 1.0
- SDXL Turbo

Models must be placed in their respective directories in the `airunner` directory.

- `--enable-debug-logs`: Enables verbose logging for debugging purposes.

---

## Missing Features

### Supported Models
- **Stable Diffusion**: SD 1.5, SDXL 1.0, SDXL Turbo.
- **LLMs**: Includes Mistral-7b and other open-source models.
- **Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text**: Fully integrated with customizable settings.

### Command-line Arguments
- `--clear-window-settings`: Resets UI settings.

## User Data Updates

### Overview
The `conversation.user_data` column has been updated to store concise, one-sentence summaries of user information. This ensures that the data remains relevant and easy to interpret. Additionally, the system avoids updating this column if no meaningful information is available.

### Key Changes
- **Concise Summaries**: The `conversation.user_data` column now stores brief summaries instead of verbose descriptions.
- **Update Conditions**: Updates to the column are skipped if no meaningful information is extracted.

### Testing
To verify these changes, unit tests have been added to ensure:
1. Concise summaries are correctly stored.
2. No updates occur when no meaningful information is available.

Run the tests using:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s src/airunner/tests
```
