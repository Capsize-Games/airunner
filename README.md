## ‚úèÔ∏è Using AI Runner

[Instructions on how to use AI Runner can be found in the wiki](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner/wiki/AI-Runner)


---

## üíæ Compiling AI Runner

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner.git
cd airunner
```

### Build from source

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install pyinstaller
bash build.dev.sh
```

## üî¨ Unit tests

Run a specific test
```bash
python -m unittest src/airunner/tests/test_draggable_pixmap.py
```

Test coverage is currently low, but the existing tests can be run using the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Test coverage

Run tests with coverage tracking:

```bash
coverage run --source=src/airunner --omit=__init__.py,*/data/*,*/tests/*,*_ui.py,*/enums.py,*/settings.py -m unittest discover src/airunner/tests
```

To see a report in the terminal, use:

```bash
coverage report
```

For a more detailed HTML report, run:

```bash
coverage html
```

View results in `htmlcov/index.html`.

### Privacy and Security

Although AI Runner v3.0 is built with Huggingface libraries, we have taken
care to strip the application of any telemetry or tracking features.

The main application itself is unable to access the internet, and we are working
towards properly sandboxing certain features to ensure user privacy and security.

As this application evolves we will migrate away from the Huggingface libraries.

### Internet access

The core application is incapable of accessing the internet. However there are two features which require
internet access. These two features are the `setup wizard` and the `model manager`.

Each of these tools are isolated in their own application windows
which are capable of directly accessing and downloading files on Huggingface.co and 
civitai.com (depending on the given URL). Any other URL will be blocked.

The Huggingface Hub library is not used to access these downloads.

For more information see the [Darklock](https://github.com/capsize-games/darklock)  and
[Facehuggershield](https://github.com/capsize-games/facehuggershield) libraries.

---

### Disc access

Write access for the transformers library has been disabled, preventing it from creating a huggingface 
cache directory at runtime.

The application itself may still access the disc for reading and writing, however we have restricted
reads and writes to the user provided `airunner` directory (by default this is located at `~/.local/share/airunner`).

All other attempts to access the disc are blocked and logged for your review.

For more information see `src/security/restrict_os_access.py`.

---

### Huggingface Hub

The Huggingface Hub is installed so that Transformers, Diffusers and other Huggingface libraries
will continue to function as expected, however it has been neutered to prevent it from accessing 
the internet.

The security measures taken for this library are as follows

- Prevented from accessing the internet
- Prevented from accessing the disc
- All environment variables set for maximum security
- All telemetry disabled

See [Facehuggershield](https://github.com/capsize-games/facehuggershield) for more information.

---

#### Planned security measures for Huggingface Libraries

We plant o remove the Huggingface libraries from the application in the future.
Although the architecture is currently dependent on these libraries, we will
migrate to a better solution in the future.

## Improving performance

To profile various functions in an effort to improve performance, you can install `line_profiler`

```bash
pip install line_profiler
```

To profile a function, add the `@profile` decorator to the function you wish to profile.

Then run the following command:

```bash
kernprof -l -v main.py
```

To view the results after

```bash
python display_profile_data.py
```
