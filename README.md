# AI Runner: Offline AI Inference Engine for Hackers, Makers, and Builders.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/392375c8-a7f6-4e6e-8662-511cffc608aa)

Here are some of the things you can do with AI Runner:

- ‚úÖ **Voice-based chatbots** for real-time conversations
- ‚úÖ **Text-to-Image** generation with **Stable Diffusion** and **ControlNet**
- ‚úÖ **Image manipulation** with **inpainting** and **outpainting**
- ‚úÖ **Text-to-Speech** (TTS) and **Speech-to-Text** (STT) using **OpenVoice**, **SpeechT5**, and **Whisper**
- ‚úÖ **Customizable AI personalities** for more engaging conversations
- ‚úÖ **Image filters** and **inpainting** for image editing
- ‚úÖ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) for enhanced LLM responses

For extra security, performance, and compatibility, AI Runner is built with **Wayland support**, **Python 3.13**, and the latest stable torch libraries.

## AI Models

By default, AI Runner installs essential TTS/STT and minimal LLM components.  
You **must supply** additional Stable Diffusion models (e.g., from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) or [Civitai](https://civitai.com/)).

Organize them under your local AI Runner data directory:
```plaintext
~/.local/share/airunner
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ art
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ models
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SD 1.5
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lora
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ embeddings
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Flux
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SDXL 1.0
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lora
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ embeddings
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SDXL Turbo
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lora
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ embeddings
```
