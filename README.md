## 🔧 Running AI Runner from source

Running AI Runner from source is recommended for developers and users who want to test the latest features.

### Linux

Install prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y fonts-noto-color-emoji
sudo apt install -y libportaudio2
sudo apt install -y libxcb-cursor0
sudo apt install -y espeak
sudo apt install -y xclip
sudo apt install -y git
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
sudo apt install -y python3.10-venv
```

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner.git
cd airunner
```

Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv airunner
source airunner/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Run AI Runner

```bash
airunner
```

---

## Using AI Runner as a Python library

AI Runner can be used as a Python library in order to extend its functionality.

```bash
pip install airunner
```

Now you can import AI Runner into your Python scripts.

```python
from airunner import airunner
```

---

## Packaging AI Runner

[Detailed packaging instructions can be found in the wiki](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner/wiki/Installation-instructions).

---

## Models

AI Runner installs all of the models required to run a chatbot with text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities,
as well as the core models required for Stable Diffusion. However, you must supply your own art generator models.

You can download models from Huggingface.co or civitai.com.

The supported Stable Diffusion models are:

- SD 1.5
- SDXL 1.0
- SDXL Turbo

Models must be placed in their respective directories in the `airunner` directory.
    
```plaintext
~/.local/share/airunner
├── art
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── SD 1.5
│   │   │   ├── lora
│   │   │   └── embeddings
│   │   ├── SDXL 1.0
│   │   │   ├── lora
│   │   │   └── embeddings
│   │   └── SDXL Turbo
│   │       ├── lora
│   │       └── embeddings
```

---

## Privacy and Security

Although AI Runner v3.0 is built with Huggingface libraries, we have taken
care to strip the application of any telemetry or tracking features.

---

### Internet access

Only the setup wizard needs access to the internet in order to download the required models.

For more information see the [Darklock](https://github.com/capsize-games/darklock)  and
[Facehuggershield](https://github.com/capsize-games/facehuggershield) libraries.

---

### Disc access

Write access for the transformers library has been disabled, preventing it from creating a huggingface 
cache directory at runtime.

The application itself may still access the disc for reading and writing, however we have restricted
reads and writes to the user provided `airunner` directory (by default this is located at `~/.local/share/airunner`).

All other attempts to access the disc are blocked and logged for your review.

For more information see `src/security/restrict_os_access.py`.

---

### Huggingface Hub

**_Huggingface Hub  contains telemetry and tracking features that have been completely disabled in AI Runner._**

The security measures taken for this library are as follows

- Prevented from accessing the internet
- Prevented from accessing the disc
- All environment variables set for maximum security
- All telemetry disabled

See [Facehuggershield](https://github.com/capsize-games/facehuggershield) for more information.
