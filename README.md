## Introduction

AI Runner is an interface that allows you to run open-source large language models (LLM) and AI image generators (Stable Diffusion) on your own hardware.

It is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to run AI models without the need for a web server or cloud service.

It has been optimized for speed and efficiency, allowing you to generate images and have conversations with chatbots in real-time.

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip install -e .[linux]
pip install --upgrade timm==1.0.15
```

[Detailed packaging and installation instructions can be found in the wiki](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner/wiki/Installation-instructions).

### Running

Run the application with the following command

```bash
airunner
```

## AI Models

AI Runner installs all of the models required to run a chatbot with text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities,
as well as the core models required for Stable Diffusion. However, you must supply your own art generator models.

You can download models from Huggingface.co or civitai.com.

The supported Stable Diffusion models are:

- SD 1.5
- SDXL 1.0
- SDXL Turbo

Models must be placed in their respective directories in the `airunner` directory.
    
```plaintext
~/.local/share/airunner
├── art
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── SD 1.5
│   │   │   ├── lora
│   │   │   └── embeddings
│   │   ├── SDXL 1.0
│   │   │   ├── lora
│   │   │   └── embeddings
│   │   └── SDXL Turbo
│   │       ├── lora
│   │       └── embeddings
```

---

## Unit Tests

Run all unit tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s src/airunner/tests
```

Run a single unit test

```bash
python -m unittest src/airunner/tests/<file_name>
```

Example
```bash
python -m unittest src/airunner/tests/test_prompt_weight_convert.py
```

## Database

See the [database wiki page](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner/wiki/Database) for details on how to switch engines, make changes to data models and run migrations.
