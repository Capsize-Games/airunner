## Introduction

AI Runner is a local-first tool that allows you to run open-source large language models (LLM) and AI image generators (Stable Diffusion) on your own hardware, without the need for a web server or cloud service.

It has been optimized for speed and efficiency, allowing you to generate images and have conversations with chatbots in real-time.

AI Runner can also be installed as a library and used in your projects, such as pygame
or PySide6 applications. See ["Use with Pygame"](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner/wiki/Use-with-Pygame) wikipage for more info.


## GUI

Interact with chatbots, adjust settings, modify preferences, change the theme.

- Built with Pyside6
- Feather icons
- Choose from Light / Dark / System themes
- Completely disable Stable Diffusion using [environment variables](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner/wiki/Settings)

## üöÄ Installation

### üêã Docker

This is the fastest and recommended way to run AI Runner locally.

1. [First install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit for Docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) and make sure you [don't forget the Configuring Docker section](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#configuring-docker). This step is crucial as it allows Docker to utilize the GPU on your host machine.
2. Clone this repo then run setup.sh - this will allow you to run AI Runner scripts locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner.git
cd airunner
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
./src/airunner/bin/setup.sh
```

You will be presented with several options

```bash
1) Setup xhost for Docker                       3) Install AI Runner locally (not recommended)
2) Install AI Runner scripts                    4) Quit
```

3. Choose option 1
4. Choose option 2
5. Choose the "Quit" option.
6. Start AI Runner with the command `airunner-docker airunner`

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Installation Wiki](https://github.com/Capsize-Games/airunner/wiki/Installation-instructions).

Now you can run AI Runner 

```bash
airunner-docker airunner
```

## AI Models

AI Runner installs all of the models required to run a chatbot with text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities,
as well as the core models required for Stable Diffusion. However, you must supply your own art generator models.

You can download models from Huggingface.co or civitai.com.

The supported Stable Diffusion models are:

- SD 1.5
- SDXL 1.0
- SDXL Turbo

Models must be placed in their respective directories in the `airunner` directory.
    
```plaintext
~/.local/share/airunner
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ art
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SD 1.5
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lora
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ embeddings
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SDXL 1.0

‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lora
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ embeddings
```

## Unit Tests

Run all unit tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s src/airunner/tests
```

Run a single unit test

Example
```bash
python -m unittest src/airunner/tests/test_prompt_weight_convert.py
```
